title: 'Beyond Usability and Performance: A Review of User Experience-focused Evaluations
  in Visualization.'
venue: BELIV

Traditionally, studies of data visualization techniques and systems have evaluated visualizations with respect to usability goals such as effectiveness and efficiency. These studies assess performance-related metrics such as time and correctness of participants completing analytic tasks. Alternatively, several studies in InfoVis recently have evaluated visualizations by investigating user experience goals such as memorability, engagement, enjoyment and fun. These studies employ somewhat different evaluation methodologies to assess these other goals. The growing number of these studies, their alternative methodologies, and disagreements concerning their importance have motivated us to more carefully examine them. In this article, we review this growing collection of visualization evaluations that examine user experience goals and we discuss multiple issues regarding the studies including questions about their motivation and utility. Our aim is to provide a resource for future work that plans to evaluate visualizations using these goals.
