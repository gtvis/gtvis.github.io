  description: >
    In April, Alberto Cairo from the University of Miami visited and talked about his work. Alberto discussed how people often misinterpret visualizations, and what we can do to help this and to create better visualizations in general. Alberto spent the day with us in the GT Vis Lab, and also was the external member of John Thompson’s PhD thesis proposal committee.
